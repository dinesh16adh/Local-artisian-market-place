**State Management**:
- **`cartItems`**: Stores items added to the cart, updated through the `addToCart` function.
  
**Routes**:
- The app uses `react-router-dom` for navigation between pages such as `HomePage`, `Contact`, `About`, and `Collection`.

### 2. `HomePage.jsx`

**Purpose**: Displays the main product listing, hero banner, and categories filter.

**Components Used**:

- **Ourpolicies**: Shows business policies like return/exchange.
- **ProductModal**: A modal popup for viewing product details.

**State**:
- **`visibleProducts`** controls pagination for products.
- **`categoryFilter`** filters products by category.

**Key Functions**:
- `handleAddToCart`: Adds a product to the cart and triggers the `CartModal` to show the added item.

### 8. `ProductModal.jsx`

- **Image Carousel**: `ProductModal` and `ProductSlider` control image transitions, supporting both autoplay and manual navigation.
- **Zoom Effect**: `ProductModal` handles `transform-origin` calculations for zoom functionality based on mouse position.
